# Events configure project

Implementation of this project I started with the installation of necessary packages to Node.js using **npm**. Initialize Node.js to my project and got configure file _package.json_ .

<< To start working with my project, you are needed to initialize this package.json file in your project directory. You can do it by writing the command _**npm init**_ >>

Next, I used a local server and configured it to "listening" a some _PORT_ . Also, for convenience, I installed **nodemon**, that helps in development, because it independently updates server operations and I don't need to do this.


For Frontend part my project, I decided to choose _**EJS**_ technology, which allows to use properties and methods of **JavaScript** while writing **HTML** code. And precisely, using this EJS, I created so-called "views" for design of my project...

<< You can also use this EJS, which allow you to manage and use it anywhere in the project. >>


And, regarding the Backend part. For for storing and interacting with data, I used database called **MongoDB** . Cluster of this database helps me in inplementation the capability of recording data and using them in the project.

<< If you also want to use the possibilities of interaction with this database in your project, then you need to create personal cluster of this service and find the link for connection, which should already be used in your server code of the project (where defining the database model) >>
